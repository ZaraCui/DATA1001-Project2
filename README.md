# DATA1001-Project2

This project was done in May, 2025. It is a individual project in my DATA1001 Foundations of Data Science class. I mainly focused on a dataset of breast cancer and managed to suggest finding targeted treatment through investigating survival outcomes by estrogen receptor status in breast cancer.

The National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) is Australia's leading not-for-profit organisation funding world-class breast cancer research. NBCF is committed to achieving zero deaths from breast cancer by 2030 through targeted funding and strategic research partnerships.

Through several data sicnetific approaches, I recommend implementing early intervention and tailored treatment for estrogen receptor-negative patients, based on the significantly shorter median survival and greater outcome variability observed in statistical analysis, which aligns with external evidence on breast cancer tumor behavior and supports NBCF's mission of reducing mortality through strategic interventions.
